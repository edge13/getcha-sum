/**
 * A client that handles authentication and requests to the Singly API.
 * 
 * An application must be authenticated and retrieve an access token for an 
 * account before it can make Singly API calls for that account.  The process
 * for authentication has three steps.
 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The application use the {@link #getAuthenticationUrl(String, String)}
 *   method and redirect the user to the authentication web page for the service
 *   against which the user is authenticating.</li>
 *   <li>Once the user authenticates the web page is redirected back to the
 *   redirectUrl in the application.  A <strong>code</strong> parameter is 
 *   parsed from the redirectUrl.  This is the authentication code.</li>
 *   <li>The application calls the {@link #completeAuthentication(String, String)}
 *   method with the authentication code and account to store the access token
 *   for that account.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Once an access token is stored for an account, calls can be made to the API
 * using the doXApiRequest methods and passing in an account.  The access token
 * will be retrieved behind the scenes and passed to all API calls.
 * 
 * @see https://singly.com/docs/api
